<h1 align="center">Focus on your task</h1>

Focus is a cross-platform productivity timer for the command line. It is based
on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), a
time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.

## üçÖ How it works

1. Pick a task you need to accomplish.
2. Set a timer for 25 minutes and start working without interruptions.
3. When the timer rings, take a short break for 5 minutes.
4. Once you've completed four work sessions, you can take a longer 15 minute
   break.

## ‚ú® Main features

- Work and break session lengths are customisable.
- You can pause and resume work sessions.
- You can skip break sessions.
- **Flow timer mode**: Count-up timer with task tracking and milestone notifications.
- You can customise the number of sessions before a long break.
- You can set a maximum number of sessions.
- Desktop notifications are supported on all platforms.
- You can customise the notification messages.
- Detailed statistics for your work history are provided including charts.
- Focus provides six built-in ambient sounds that you can play during a session,
  and you can add your own custom sounds.

## ‚ö° Installation

Focus is written in Go, so you can install it through `go install` (requires Go
1.16 or later):

```bash
go install github.com/ayoisaiah/focus/cmd/focus@latest
```

On Linux, the `libasound2-dev` package is required to compile Focus. Ubuntu or
Debian users can install it through the command below:

```bash
sudo apt install libasound2-dev
```

### üì¶ NPM Package

You can also install Focus through its
[NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ayoisaiah/focus):

With `npm`:

```bash
npm i @ayoisaiah/focus -g
```

With `yarn`:

```bash
yarn global add @ayoisaiah/focus
```

Other installation methods are
[available here](https://github.com/ayoisaiah/focus/wiki/Installation/).

## üöÄ Usage

Once Focus is installed, run it using the command below:

```
focus
```

**Note:** Only one instance of `focus` can be active at a time.

## ‚öô Configuration

When you run Focus for the first time, it will prompt you to set your preferred
timer lengths, and how many sessions before a long break. Afterwards, you may
change these values by using command-line options or editing the `config.yml`
file which will be located in `~/.config/focus/` on Linux,
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\focus` on Windows, and `~/Library/Application Support/focus` on
macOS.

Here's the default configuration settings:

```yml
work_mins: 25 # work session length

work_msg: Focus on your task # work session message (shown in terminal and notification)

short_break_mins: 5 # short break session length

short_break_msg: Take a breather # short break session message (shown in terminal and notification)

long_break_mins: 15 # long break session length

long_break_msg: Take a long break # long break session message (shown in terminal and notification)

long_break_interval: 4 # number of sessions before long break

notify: true # show desktop notifications

auto_start_work: false # Automatically start the next work session

auto_start_break: true # Automatically start the next break session

24hr_clock: false # Show time in 24 hour format

sound: '' # name of ambient sound to play

sound_on_break: false # play ambient sound during break sessions

dark_theme: true # use colours befitting a dark background

flow_bell: true # play bell sounds at flow timer milestones (50% and 100%)

flow_bell_sound: 'tibetan_bell' # sound file for flow timer bells (bell, loud_bell, tibetan_bell)

session_cmd: '' # execute an arbitrary command after each session
```

If you specify a command-line argument while running focus, it will override the
corresponding value in the config file.

## ‚è≥ Sessions

Focus has 3 types of sessions: work, short break, and long break.

### üíº Work sessions

- Set to 25 minutes length by default. Use the `--work` or `-w` option to change
  the length, or change `work_mins` in the `config.yml` file.
- Message displayed in the terminal and desktop notification can be changed
  using `work_msg`.
- You can pause a work session by pressing `Ctrl-C`. Use `focus resume` to
  continue from where you stopped.
- The `focus resume` command supports the `--sound`, `--sound-on-break`, and
  `--disable-notification` flags.
- If `auto_start_work` is `false`, you will be prompted to start each work
  session manually. Otherwise if set to `true`, it will start without your
  intervention.
- The maximum number of work sessions can be set using the `--max-sessions` or
  `-max` option. After that number is reached, focus will exit.
- Use the `--long-break-interval` or `-int` option to set the number of work
  sessions before a long break, or change `long_break_interval` in your
  `config.yml`.

### üòé Break sessions

- Short break is 5 minutes by default. Use the `--short-break` or `-s` option to
  change the length, or set`short_break_mins` in the `config.yml` file.
- Long break is 15 minutes by default. Use the `--long-break` or `-l` option to
  change the length, or set `long_break_mins` in the `config.yml` file.
- Message displayed in the terminal and desktop notification can be changed
  using `short_break_msg` and `long_break_msg`.
- Pressing `Ctrl-C` during a break session will interrupt it. Run `focus resume`
  to skip to the next work session.
- If `auto_start_break` is `false`, you will be prompted to start each break
  session manually. Otherwise if set to `true`, it will start without your
  intervention.

### ‚è∞ Flow timer mode

Flow timer mode is an alternative to the traditional Pomodoro technique that counts up instead of down, allowing for more flexible work sessions. Use the `--flow` or `-f` option to enable flow mode:

```bash
focus --flow
```

When you start flow mode, you'll be prompted to:

1. **Enter a task name** - What you're working on (e.g., "Writing blog post")
2. **Set estimated time** - How long you expect to work (e.g., "25m", "1h30m")

#### Flow mode features:

- **Count-up timer**: Shows elapsed time instead of counting down
- **Visual progress**: Displays elapsed vs estimated time with a progress bar
- **Overtime indicator**: Time turns red when you exceed your estimated time
- **Milestone notifications**: Desktop notifications and optional bell sounds at 50% and 100% of estimated time
- **Flexible duration**: Continue working past your estimate or stop early as needed
- **Task tracking**: Your task name is included in the session record

#### Flow bell configuration:

Flow timer bells are enabled by default and can be configured in your `config.yml`:

```yml
flow_bell: true               # Enable/disable flow timer bells
flow_bell_sound: 'tibetan_bell'  # Which sound to use (bell, loud_bell, tibetan_bell)
```

Available flow bell sounds:
- `bell` - Standard bell sound
- `loud_bell` - Louder bell sound  
- `tibetan_bell` - Peaceful Tibetan singing bowl (default)

You can disable flow bells by setting `flow_bell: false` in your config.

#### Visual feedback:

Focus provides visual feedback for control states:
- **Play/pause button**: The active state (`play` or `pause`) is highlighted in neon green
- **Sound button**: Highlighted in neon green when ambient sound is active
- **Controls**: Use `p` for play/pause, `s` for sound selection, and `q` to quit

## Tagging sessions

You can use the `--tag` or `-t` flag to apply a tag to a new session:

```bash
focus --tag 'side-project'
```

Multiple tags are supported (use commas to separate each):

```bash
focus --tag 'side-project,focus'
```

## üîî Notifications

![Focus notification](https://ik.imagekit.io/turnupdev/focus-notify_igz_8z0Jnp.png)

Notifications are turned on by default. Set `notify` to `false` in your config
file, or use the `--disable-notification` flag if you don't want notifications
once a session ends.

## üîä Ambient sounds

Focus provides six ambient sounds by default: `coffee_shop`, `playground`,
`wind`, `rain`, `summer_night`, and `fireplace`. You can play a sound using the
`--sound` option, or set a default sound in your config file through the `sound`
key.

```bash
focus --sound 'coffee_shop'
```

If you want to play a custom sound instead, copy the file (supports MP3, FLAC,
OGG, and WAV) to the appropriate directory for your operating system:

- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/focus/static`
- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA\focus\static`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/focus/static`

Afterwards, specify the name of the file in the `sound` key or `--sound` option.
**Note that custom sounds must include the file extension**.

```bash
focus --sound 'university.mp3'
focus --sound 'subway.ogg'
focus --sound 'airplane.wav'
focus --sound 'stadium_noise.flac'
```

By default, ambient sounds are played only during work sessions. They are paused
during break sessions, and resumed again in the next work session. If you'd like
to retain the ambient sound during a break session, set the `sound_on_break`
config option to `true`, or use the `--sound-on-break` or `-sob` flag.

You can also disable sounds when starting or resuming a session by setting
`--sound` to `off`:

```bash
focus --sound 'off'
focus resume --sound 'off'
```

## üìà Statistics & History

```bash
focus stats
```

The above command will display your work history for the last 7 days by default.
You'll see how many work sessions you completed, how many you abandoned, and how
long you focused for overall. It also displays a break down by week, and hour to
let you know what times you tend to be productive.

You can change the reporting period through the `--period` or `-p` option. It
accepts the following values: _today_, _yesterday_, _7days_, _14days_, _30days_,
_90days_, _180days_, _365days_, _all-time_.

```bash
focus stats -p 'today'
focus stats -p 'all-time'
```

You can also set a specific time period using the `--start` and `--end` options.
The latter defaults to the current day if not specified. See the list of
acceptable formats in the
[project wiki](https://github.com/ayoisaiah/focus/wiki/Acceptable-datetime-formats-for-filtering).

```bash
focus stats --start '2021-08-06'
focus stats --start '2021-08-06' --end '2021-08-07'
focus stats --start '2021-07-23 12:00:05 PM' --end '2021-07-29 03:25:00 AM'
```

### üìÉ Listing sessions

Use the `list` command to display a table of your work sessions instead of
aggregated statistics. Use the `--period` or `--start` and `--end` option to
change the reporting period (defaults to the last 7 days).

```bash
focus list
```

```

**Note:**

- Sessions that cross over to a new day will count towards that day's sessions.
- A session with an empty end date indicates that the process was ended such a
  way that a graceful shutdown was not possible.

### ‚úí Editing sessions

You can edit the tags of one or more sessions through the `edit-tag` command. It
accepts the same options as the `list` command to select the sessions to be
edited. The tags are command-line arguments. You will be prompted before the
update is carried out.

The command below edits the tags of all sessions recorded `today` and tagged
with `writing`. It updates the tags for each session to writing, novel, and
`once-upon-a-time`.

```bash
focus edit-tag --tag 'writing' -p 'today' 'writing' 'novel' 'once-upon-a-time'
```
